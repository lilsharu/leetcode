# 41. First Missing Positive

The $O(n \log n)$ solution is easy: sort the array and iterate over it to find the first "jump" in the sequence. However, the $O(n)$ solution (that also just uses $O(1)$ space) is a bit trickier.

- We can take advantage of two key factors: negative numbers don't matter and numbers larger than the size of the given
  array don't matter.
- Now, we can use the actual given array as a table to determine if we've seen a value already: use each index as a way to
  mark off that we've seen a number. The easiest way to do this without losing any elements is to swap elements into
  their correct index.
- We can then iterate through the array and find the first index that doesn't match the value at that index. This will be
    the first missing positive number.
